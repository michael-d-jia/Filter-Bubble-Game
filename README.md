# Filter Bubble - Media Maze Game

A maze game that demonstrates how media consumption shapes our perception of reality. Navigate through a dynamic maze that transforms based on the news sources you collect, visualizing how information echo chambers affect our worldview.

## Game Concept

In Filter Bubble, you navigate through a maze where walls literally appear and disappear based on which news sources you collect. This creates a tangible metaphor for how our media choices don't just inform us—they shape the very landscape of possibilities we can perceive.

## Educational Themes

- **Media Literacy**: Understanding how different news sources present different realities
- **Echo Chambers**: Experiencing how single-source information creates limited perspectives
- **Balanced Consumption**: Discovering that diverse sources provide optimal paths forward
- **Critical Thinking**: Questioning how our information diet shapes our options

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move your character
- **TAB**: Show locations of uncollected news sources
- **SPACE**: Emergency respawn at start (if stuck)
- **R**: Restart game (after completion)
- **ESC**: Exit game

### Objective
Navigate to the yellow exit square while discovering how different news sources affect your available paths.

### News Sources
- **Red Source (A)**: Reveals certain paths while closing others
- **Blue Source (B)**: Opens different routes through the maze
- **Both Sources**: Provides the optimal path to the exit

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze System**: Walls change in real-time based on collected sources
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded worldviews (gray, red, blue, purple)
- **Multiple Endings**: Different messages based on your media consumption choices
- **Educational Metaphor**: Experience firsthand how echo chambers limit perspective

## Completion States

1. **Balanced View Achievement**: Collected both sources - optimal perspective
2. **Limited Perspective**: Collected only one source - narrow worldview
3. **Missed Opportunities**: No sources collected - uninformed journey

## Visual Design

- **Gray Maze**: Neutral/uninfluenced state
- **Reddish Tint**: Influenced by Source A
- **Bluish Tint**: Influenced by Source B
- **Purple Tint**: Balanced perspective with both sources
- **Yellow Flash**: Momentary disorientation when worldview shifts

**Design Philosophy**: Rather than telling players about media literacy, we let them experience it. The frustration of hitting invisible walls mirrors real-world discovery of our own biases, while finding new paths after collecting sources reinforces the value of diverse perspectives.
